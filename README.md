The book management system consists of a front-end interface for user interaction and a back-end server, database, and application logic for storing and processing book data.

## Project Description
The book management system is a comprehensive platform that allows users to manage books and lending history. Users can create accounts with different roles, such as administrator, librarian, or reader, and access different menus based on their role.The system enables users to manage books by adding, editing, and deleting book records, as well as searching and sorting books by various criteria such as title, author, and publication date. Users can also view detailed information about each book, including its lending history, availability status, and borrower information.In addition, the system allows users to lend books to readers and manage the lending history. Librarians can create lending records, assign due dates, and track the return status of each book. Readers can view their borrowing history, renew loans, and place holds on books that are currently checked out.
Overall, your book management system provides a user-friendly interface for managing book data and lending history, while also ensuring that users have appropriate access based on their role. The system is designed to be efficient and reliable, making it an ideal choice for libraries and other organizations that need to manage large collections of books and lending records.
