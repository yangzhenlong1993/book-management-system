The book management system consists of a front-end interface for user interaction and a back-end server, database, and application logic for storing and processing book data.

## Project Description

The book management system allows users to create accounts with different roles, manage books by adding, editing, and deleting records, and lend books to readers while tracking lending history. The system provides a user-friendly interface and appropriate access based on roles, making it an efficient and reliable choice for managing book collections.
